I'd like to check in my weechat config, but unfortunately weechat tends to modify lots of stuff in this folder
a lot. So I'll record the list of steps to set up weechat in the desired fashion.

* sudo apt-get install weechat # This should install weechat-curses
* get weeget:
  $ cd ~/.weechat/python/autoload
  $ wget http://www.weechat.org/files/scripts/weeget.py
* start up weechat with weechat-curses
* /python autoload
* /weeget list # to show all packages
* /weeget install buffers
