# Ghostty issues to sort out:
# - There's a GTK bug where navigating splits does the wrong thing
#   https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/issues/524
#   https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/pull/5654

# TODOs to get functionality I used in tmux:
# - Keyboard-based selection (right now I can only expand/contract the
#   selection, but not create it).
#     https://github.com/ghostty-org/ghostty/discussions/3488
# - Name/rename tabs
#   Can name a window with echo -en "\033]0;Blah blah\a"
#     The no-title option helps
#     But when you open a new split, that takes over
#     Maybe splits could inherit the title by default?
