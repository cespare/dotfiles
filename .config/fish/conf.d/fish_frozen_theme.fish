# Don't edit this file, as it will be written by the web-config tool (`fish_config`).
# To customize your theme, delete this file and see
#     help interactive#syntax-highlighting
# or
#     man fish-interactive | less +/^SYNTAX.HIGHLIGHTING
# for appropriate commands to add to ~/.config/fish/config.fish instead.
# See also the release notes for fish 4.3.0 (run `help relnotes`).
