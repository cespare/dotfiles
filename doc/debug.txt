Notes about troubleshooting/debugging issues that I may want to refer to
in the future.

# Auto display backlight dimming on Dell XPS 13

The screen of this machine dims automatically depending on the content of the
screen (brighter when the screen is mostly white, for example). This leads to
incredibly annoying behavior when using white text on dark background (say vim
in full-screen) where the backlight constantly changes its setting.

Disable this in the BIOS:
    Video > Dynamic Backlight Control > Disabled

# "Failed to connect to lvmetad" boot error

I randomly got an error on boot like

  WARNING: Failed to connect to lvmetad. Falling back to device scanning.
  ...
  ALERT! /some/disk does not exist.
  ...

It looks like this was caused by a bad BIOS setting. (Not sure how it got
reset.) The fix is:

  System Configuration > SATA Operation > Change "RAID On" to "AHCI"
