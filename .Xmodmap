! Hint:
! setxkbmap -layout us
! resets the keyboard layout completely (then you can run xmodmap again).

! Make escape caps lock and make caps lock another control. Then with xcape, I will make control act as escape
! when pressed and immediately released.
remove Lock = Caps_Lock
keysym Escape = Caps_Lock
keysym Caps_Lock = Control_L
! xcape needs Escape to be assigned to something. Nothing on my keyboards sends keycode 255.
keycode 255 = Escape
! Disable left control for now to train myself not to use it. Maybe use it as a fancy extra modifier later.
keycode 37 = NoSymbol
add Lock = Caps_Lock
add Control = Control_L
